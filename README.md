_5 min walkthrough of the app_

This is a web tool which allows you to take armies from OPR's Army Forge, and assign model loadouts and equipment definitions.

From there, your loadout can be exported and then imported into Tabletop Simulator, providing you with an easy interface to assign stats and rules to your models.

Thanks to Army Forge and its developers for support in making this tool possible, and to users over on the OPR Discord for their valuable feedback.
