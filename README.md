### A webapp to take lists from [OPR's](https://www.onepagerules.com/) [Army Forge](https://army-forge.onepagerules.com/) and allow the user to set and configure model definitons, which can then in turn be imported into Tabletop Simulator directly.

To be used in conjunction with the sister TTS mod, "OPR AF to TTS Importer", available here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2969376266
